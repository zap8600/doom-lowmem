# doom-lowmem
Ports of DOOM to other platforms, made to use minimal resources on each system. Based on [GBADoom](https://github.com/doomhack/GBADoom).
## Why?
Because I want DOOM on many platforms, but not all of them meet DOOM's minimum requirements. I originally planned for this to be a generic version of DOOM to be ported, but after closer inspection of GBADoom, I realized that the port was specifically made for the GBA, using features only it has. Therefore, I figured I would just add all of the ports I want to this code.
